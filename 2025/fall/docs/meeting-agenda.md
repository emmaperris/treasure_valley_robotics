## Our Team Setup

**How many robots do we have?**
- We will build 3 robots total (A, B, and C)

**How many robots run at once?**
- Only 2 robots run at the same time
- Robot A runs EVERY time (Emma's robot)
- Either Robot B OR Robot C runs with it (we choose which one)

**Why this way?**
- Robots B and C do the same job
- We can pick whichever one is working better
