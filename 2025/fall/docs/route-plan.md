# Route Plan

## Robot Configuration
- **Robots per run:** 2 (Robot A always runs + either Robot B or Robot C)
- **Total robots built:** 3

## Robot A (Emma)
**Runs in:** Every competition run

**Objective:** Pull Botguy + 2 pallets from Upper Storage → Lower Storage

**Build idea:** Rake-like design

**Estimated points:** 20+ points

## Robot B (Lila)
**Runs in:** Some competition runs (alternates with Robot C)

**Objective:** Move 2 pallets from Raised Loading Dock → Lower Storage

**Build idea:** Tall arm with rake or pusher to get pallets off the shelf

**Estimated points:** TBD

## Robot C (Stella)
**Runs in:** Some competition runs (alternates with Robot B)

**Objective:** Same as Robot B - move 2 pallets from Raised Loading Dock → Lower Storage

**Build idea:** Tall arm with rake or pusher (similar to Robot B)

**Estimated points:** TBD

## Strategy Notes
- Robot A always runs (Emma's robot)
- Choose either Robot B or Robot C for each run based on which performs better
- Robots B and C do the same task, providing backup/alternative option
- Focus on reliability and repeatability
