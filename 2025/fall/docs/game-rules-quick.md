# Pallet Pushers - Quick Rules Guide

## The Basics

**Time:** 2 minutes (120 seconds)
**Goal:** Score points by moving game pieces to different areas
**Theme:** Robot warehouse workers

---

## Game Pieces We Can Move

- **Botguy** (1) - the supervisor figure
- **Big Cubes** (3) - Red, Brown, Green (4" size)
- **Small Cubes** (12) - Red, Yellow, Green (2" size)
- **Poms** (24) - Orange and Blue fuzzballs
- **Pallets** (4) - flat platforms to put things on
- **Baskets** (2) - containers for poms
- **Traffic Cones** (2) - DON'T TOUCH! They make areas score zero!
- **PVC Pipes** (8) - can score 30 points each

---

## Important Rules

### The Big Ones
1. **Stop Rule** - Robots MUST stop moving by the end or we lose!
2. **Traffic Cone Rule** - If a cone touches an area, NOTHING in that area scores
3. **Black Tape Rule** - Things on black tape don't score
4. **Starting Box** - Robots must fit in a 12" tall box at the start
5. **4 Structure Limit** - We can only have 4 separate things (including our 3 robots)

### Sorting = More Points
- **Sorted** means at least 2 of the same color together with NO other colors
- Only works for cubes and poms
- Sorted items score MORE points!

## Best Ways to Score Points

### Our Team's Focus (What We're Actually Doing)
- **Botguy in Lower Storage** = 20 points
- **Get all 4 pallets into Lower Storage**

### What We're NOT Doing
- No cubes
- No poms
- No baskets
- No traffic cones
- No PVC pipes

**Why?** We want simple, reliable robots that work every time!

---

## Starting Positions (Where Things Start)

- **Botguy** - On top of Upper Storage
- **Big Cubes** - On Upper Storage (red left, brown middle, green right)
- **Small Cubes** - In Lower Storage (stacked in corners)
- **Baskets** - In Pom Sorter area
- **Poms** - In Pom Storage areas
- **PVC Pipes** - In Outdoor Unloading Dock
- **Traffic Cones** - Near Pom Storage areas (AVOID!)

---

## Our Robot Setup

**Setup Time:** 90 seconds to get ready
**Starting:** We have 2 Starting Boxes but 3 robots - need to fit 2 robots in 1 box OR ask judges about alternatives
**Light Sensor:** Each robot needs one to know when to start

---

## What We're Building With

### Our Team's Build Materials
- **LEGO pieces** - main building material
- **Metal parts** - structural support (can't cut them!)
- **Screws** - for attaching parts
- **Motors** - for wheels/movement
- **Servos** - for arms/pushers/rakes
- **Light sensors** - to know when to start
- **Batteries and controllers**

### We're Keeping It Simple
- No 3D printed parts (we don't need them)
- No camera (too complicated)
- No extra materials unless we really need them
- Focus on reliable, repeatable robots

---

## Competition Format

1. **Seeding Rounds** (3 times) - We play alone, score counts on whole board
2. **Double Elimination** - Play against other teams, need to lose twice to be out
3. **Best 2 out of 3** - For seeding, our best 2 scores get averaged

---

## Tips to Remember

- Items score where they end up, not how they got there
- Judges wait for everything to stop moving before scoring
- If we disagree with score, tell judges BEFORE leaving the table
- We get ONE timeout card for the whole tournament (save it!)
- Adults can't help once we're in the pit area
- Must stop ALL motors and servos by the end

---

## Our Team Strategy

**Main Goal:** Get all 4 pallets and Botguy into Lower Storage!

1. **Robot A** - Move pallets from Raised Loading Dock to Lower Storage
2. **Robot B** - Pull Botguy and his pallets into Lower Storage
3. **Robot C** - (To be decided)
4. Make sure robots don't crash into each other
5. ALWAYS make sure robots stop before time ends!
