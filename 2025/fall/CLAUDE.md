# Team Context for Claude Code

## Team Information
- **Team Name:** Treasure Valley Robotics
- **Competition:** 2026 Botball Fall Virtual Tournament
- **Game:** Pallet Pushers
- **Team Members:**
  - Emma Perris (12-13 years old) - Building and coding Robot A
  - Lila McGehee (12-13 years old) - Building and coding Robot B
  - Stella McGehee (12-13 years old) - Building and coding Robot C
- **Number of Robots Built:** 3 total
- **Number of Robots Per Run:** 2 (Robot A + either Robot B or Robot C)

## Team Strategy

### Core Approach
The team is focusing on **simple, reliable, repeatable** tasks rather than complex scoring opportunities.

### Robot Roles

See [route-plan.md](docs/route-plan.md) for detailed robot objectives and build ideas.

**Summary:**
- **Robot A (Emma):** Runs EVERY time - pulls Botguy + pallets from Upper Storage
- **Robot B (Lila):** Alternates with Robot C - moves pallets from Raised Loading Dock
- **Robot C (Stella):** Alternates with Robot B - same task as Robot B (backup option)

### Competition Run Configuration
- **Always:** Robot A runs
- **Choice:** Either Robot B OR Robot C runs (never both together)
- **Never:** All 3 robots on the table at once
- Robots B and C do the same task, allowing team to choose the better-performing robot for each run

### What We're NOT Doing
- ❌ No cubes
- ❌ No poms
- ❌ No baskets
- ❌ No traffic cones
- ❌ No PVC pipes on storage posts

**Why?** The team wants robots that work consistently every time, not complex mechanisms that might fail.

## Build Constraints

### Materials We're Using
- LEGO pieces (main building material)
- Metal parts (structural support - cannot be cut!)
- Screws for attaching parts
- Motors (for wheels/movement)
- Servos (for arms/pushers/rakes)
- Light sensors (each robot needs one to start)
- Batteries and Wombat controllers

### Materials We're NOT Using
- No camera (too complicated)
- No color sensors
- Keeping extra materials to minimum

### Kit Limitations
- Team has multiple kits available for building
- Parts constraint: Emma's Robot A + EITHER Lila's Robot B OR Stella's Robot C must not exceed the official parts list
- Only 2 robots run at a time (Robot A always + either B or C)
- Only 2 Starting Boxes needed (one robot per box)
- Maximum 4 independent structures allowed per run

## Important Rules to Remember

### Critical Rules
1. **Stop Rule:** All robots MUST stop all motor and servo motion by the end of 120 seconds or the team loses
2. **Starting Box:** All robots must fit within 12" tall starting boxes at game start
3. **No Adult Help:** Once in pit area, students work independently
4. **One Timeout Card:** Team gets ONE timeout for entire tournament

### Game Timing
- Setup time: 90 seconds
- Game time: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- Seeding rounds: Best 2 out of 3 scores averaged

## Communication Style

### Age-Appropriate Language
- Team members are 12-13 years old
- Use simple, clear language
- Avoid overly technical jargon
- Keep explanations short and focused
- No unnecessary emojis
- No exclamations

### Documentation Preferences
- Keep documents SHORT and easy to understand
- Focus on what the team is actually doing, not all possibilities
- Remove complex strategies that don't apply to their approach
- Emphasize reliability over maximum points

## Key Files

- `docs/game-rules-official.md` - Official complete game rules (600+ lines, technical)
- `docs/game-rules-quick.md` - Simplified rules guide for team
- `docs/meeting-agenda.md` - Meeting agenda (simplified for age group)
- `docs/route-plan.md` - Current strategy plan and robot objectives

## Design Philosophy

The team prioritizes:
1. **Reliability** - Robots that work every time
2. **Simplicity** - Easy to build, test, and debug
3. **Repeatability** - Consistent performance
4. **Mechanical solutions** - Using LEGOs, metal parts, and screws

## Current Status

### Decided
- Robot objectives defined (see route-plan.md for details)
- Build approach: Simple, reliable, LEGO-based
- Run configuration: Always Robot A + either Robot B or Robot C
- Team members build AND code their own robots

## Notes for AI Assistance

- Don't suggest complex scoring strategies (PVC pipes, sorted cubes, poms, etc.)
- Remember: Only 2 robots run at a time (Robot A + either B or C)
- Parts constraint applies to Robot A + Robot B combo OR Robot A + Robot C combo
- Emma works independently on Robot A
- Emphasize testing and reliability over maximum points
- Keep all suggestions age-appropriate for 12-13 year olds, who are very smart.
- Keep in mind that this team won this competition last season against highschool students.
